Joystick Input
- add curve to joystick inputs
- look into cheesy drive? https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/software/robotics-basics/curvature-cheesy-drive

Odometry
- test Odometry
- run odometry in a separate thread
- organize odometry code
    - should it be in drivetrain? or outside of drivetrain?
    - if implemented thread, inside drivetrain makes sense
- need some way to visualize odometry

Util files
- need PID, angles, poses

Motion Planning
- what does 254 do :0
- IDEAL GOAL:
    - function to align to scoring position from anywhere on the field
    - Reeds Shepp planning or some other tank path following algorithm
        combined with object avoidance
        - could APF work if path following generates vectors to follow?
    - function to automatically spit out cube if in range of the target
- IF IDEAL GOAL:
    - autos become a bit easier, just a matter of copy-pasting a bunch
        of functions

- kinda cool path plan website: https://ashton254.github.io/VEX-ZED-Path-Planner/
    - more so for coordinates
- a lot more sophisticated path following tool: https://docs.path.jerryio.com/docs/formats/LemLibFormatV0_5
